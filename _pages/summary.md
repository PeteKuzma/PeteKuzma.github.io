# <a id="PriswCen"></a>[*A pristine view of galactic globular clusters and their peripheries: Omega Centauri*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01135)
This work utilises machine learning techniques and statistical modelling to identify stars with similar properties across multiple parameter spaces. I identified faint signatures in the large astronomical data set of Pristine using k-nearest neighbours and 2D Gaussian mixture models. Techniques including pipeline construction analysis in Python and data mining/ETL form the basis of this work, before applying machine learning. Lastly, finer details of the data are measured through Akaike information criterion techniques.

# <a id="KinwCen"></a> [*Kinematics of metallicity populations in Omega Centauri using Gaia Focused Product Release and Hubble Space Telescope*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17755)
I contributed to this work as an international collaborator, providing the techniques/pipeline in a Jupyter notebook, and provided insight when discussing and interpreting the results. Here, data manipulation and coordinate/spatial transformations were required to place the data in a frame of reference that required to complete the analysis. I worked with the lead author, my junior, and under their direction compiled this result along with their supervisor.
