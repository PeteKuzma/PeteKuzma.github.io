I have given many talks to audiences of varying expertise. I believe science and data communication is vital to break down the perceived barriers between complex ideas and in-depth research to the wider public. Below are example talks that I have given throughout my career. 

## Public Outreach - "The Great Galactic Graveyard of the Milky Way"
The Milky Way has not always been the size it currently is. Much like humans, it grew to its massive size over time, consuming food. However, in space, food for galaxies is small dwarf galaxies. This talk focuses on one of the aims of my research, searching the outermost regions of the Milky Way for signs of dwarf galaxies that the Milky Way has devoured, and how we can use some the oldest objects in the universe, globular star clusters, to trace those remains.

## Public Outreach - "Indigenous Australian Astronomy"
The First People of Australia have a connection to the land which is not well understood. Their methods for using the stars to help govern their way of life are truely amazing, and their oral traditions and practices place them as one of the first astromers in the world. As an Australian, I believe all should know more about the First People of Australia and I present only a snapshot of their values in this presentation.
