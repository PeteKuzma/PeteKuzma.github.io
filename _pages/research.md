## Research
My research has been based on leveraging sophisticated data models, in-depth statistical techniques and machine learning to understand the faint data structures that lie in the noise of large astronomical data sets, primarily in Python. This has involved extracting and mining raw data from telescopes and large databases with Python and SQL, transforming that data into a usable format through data manipulation and loading that data for subsequent analysis. I have gained proficiency in Python packages for numerical modelling and machine learning, such as NumPy, SciPy, Sci-Kit Learn and Pandas, by completing statistical and numerical analysis.

Additionally, I have mentored, taught and supervised undergraduate and PhD students, and both led and had senior roles in large multinational technical groups, all working towards completing new scientific projects and surveys. These all will commence operations beginning in 2025, and it is exciting to see the fruits of all the collective labour beginning to bloom.
