## Biography
I completed my PhD at the Australian National University under the supervision of Prof. Gary Da Costa and Dr. Dougal Mackey. Here, I explored the peripheries of Globular Clusters for signs of their disruption or the remnants of the dwarf galaxies they once called home. I moved to the Univeristy of Edinburgh for 5 years in 2018,  as a Commonwealth Rutherford Fellow hosted by Prof. Annette Fergusion, and then as Post-doctoral Research Assistent under Prof. Anna Lisa Varri. At the University of Edinburgh, I developed my Bayesian inference and other statistical models, and data science skills such as unsupervised machine learning to search large datasets for the faintest of signals. I was awarded the Japan Society of the Promotion of Science International Post-doctoral fellowship in 2023 to work with Dr. Miho Ishigaki, where I developed new machine learning techniques and statistical methods to analyse new state-of-the-art data sets to learn more about the periherial extended structure seen around Globular Clusters.
