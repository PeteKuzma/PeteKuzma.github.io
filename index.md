## About
I am an Astronomer and Data Scientist currently based as the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). My research has focused on galactic archaeology, studying the outermost regions of our galaxy to understand how the Milky Way formed. I focus primarily on globular star clusters, tightly compact groups of stars that are amongst the oldest objects in the universe. 

To achieve my research goals, I utilise statistical methods and tools to mine large-scale data-sets for faint signals and bring those signals to the surface. These typically involve identifying hundreds of objects within data-sets of over a billion entries.

I also play key roles within large international collaborations on the upcoming survey instruments 4MOST, PFS and WEAVE.
